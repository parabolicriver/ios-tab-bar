A tab bar for ready made images. Simply dump in your normal tab and active tab images and you have a tab bar without having to fight UIKit's default tab bar implementation. Normal and active images should add up to the tab bar's frame for best results. Tab sizes are calculated automatically based on image width and tab bar frame height. 

Feel free to use anything as you see fit. Attribution while nice isn't needed.
